The material damage by the bomb raids was slight as Finland did not offer many valuable targets for <a href="/wiki/Strategic_bombing" title="Strategic bombing">strategic bombing</a>. Very often, targets were small village depots with little value. The country had only a few modern highways in the interior, therefore making railway systems the main targets for bombers. <a href="/wiki/Rail_track" class="mw-redirect" title="Rail track">Rail tracks</a> were cut thousands of times but were hastily repaired and the Finns usually had trains running again in a matter of hours.<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">[142]</a></sup> The Soviet Air Force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February they instituted more effective tactics.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_193_154-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_193-154">[143]</a></sup></p>
<p>The largest bombing raid against the capital of Finland, <a href="/wiki/Helsinki" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, occurred on the first day of the war. The capital was bombed only a few times thereafter. All in all, Finland lost five percent of total man-hour production because of Soviet bombings.

<p>Naval activity during the Winter War was low.

<p>Finland had coastal artillery batteries to defend important harbours and naval bases along its coast. Most batteries were left over from the Imperial Russian period, with 152&#160;mm (6.0&#160;in) guns being the most numerous. Finland attempted to modernise its old guns and installed a number of new batteries, the largest of which featured a 305&#160;mm (12.0&#160;in) gun battery originally intended to block the Gulf of Finland to Soviet ships with the help of batteries on the Estonian side.<sup id="cite_ref-Lesk1999_130_164-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Lesk1999_130-164">[153]</a></sup></p>

That day, the weather was fair and visibility excellent. The Finns spotted the Soviet cruiser <a href="/wiki/Soviet_cruiser_Kirov" title="Soviet cruiser Kirov"><i>Kirov</i></a> and two destroyers. When the ships were at a range of 24&#160;km (13&#160;nmi; 15&#160;mi), the Finns opened fire with four 234&#160;mm (9.2&#160;in) coastal guns. After five minutes of firing by the coastal guns, the cruiser had been damaged by near misses and retreated. The destroyers remained undamaged, but <i>Kirov</i> suffered 17 dead and 30 wounded. The Soviets already knew the locations of the Finnish coastal batteries, but were surprised by their range.<sup id="cite_ref-Silvast_165-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Silvast-165">[154]</a></sup></p>
<p>The coastal artillery had a greater effect on land by helping to reinforce the defence in conjunction with army artillery. Two sets of fortress artillery made significant contributions to the early battles on the Karelian Isthmus and in Ladoga Karelia. These were located at <a href="/wiki/Kaarnajoki" class="mw-redirect" title="Kaarnajoki">Kaarnajoki</a> on the Eastern Isthmus and at <a href="/wiki/Mantsinsaari_Island" title="Mantsinsaari Island">Mantsi</a> on the northeastern shore of Lake Ladoga.

<p>Joseph Stalin was not pleased with the results of December in the Finnish campaign. The Red Army had been humiliated. By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was working hard to explain the failures of the Soviet military to the populace: blaming bad terrain and harsh climate, and falsely claiming that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line, and that the Americans had sent 1,000 of their best pilots to Finland. Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov was given full authority over operations in the Finnish theatre, and he ordered the suspension of frontal assaults in late December. Kliment Voroshilov was replaced with <a href="/wiki/Semyon_Timoshenko" title="Semyon Timoshenko">Semyon Timoshenko</a> as the commander of the Soviet forces in the war on 7 January.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_203-204_167-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_203-204-167">[156]</a></sup></p>
<p>The main focus of the Soviet attack was switched to the Karelian Isthmus. Timoshenko and Zhdanov reorganised and tightened control between different branches of service in the Red Army. They also changed tactical doctrines to meet the realities of the situation. All Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus were divided into two armies: the 7th and the 13th Army. The 7th Army, now under Kirill Meretskov, would concentrate 75 percent of its strength against the 16&#160;km (9.9&#160;mi) stretch of the Mannerheim Line between <a href="/wiki/Solovyovo,_Priozersky_District,_Leningrad_Oblast" title="Solovyovo, Priozersky District, Leningrad Oblast">Taipale</a> and the Munasuo swamp. Tactics would be basic: an armoured wedge for the initial breakthrough, followed by the main infantry and vehicle assault force. The Red Army would prepare by pinpointing the Finnish frontline fortifications. The <a href="/w/index.php?title=123rd_Rifle_Division&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="123rd Rifle Division (page does not exist)">123rd Rifle Division</a> then rehearsed the assault on life-size <a href="/wiki/Mockup" title="Mockup">mock-ups</a>. The Soviets shipped large numbers of new tanks and artillery pieces to the theatre. Troops were increased from ten divisions to 25–26 divisions with six or seven tank brigades and several independent tank platoons as support, totalling 600,000 soldiers.<sup id="cite_ref-Laaks1999_424-425_168-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Laaks1999_424-425-168">[157]</a></sup> On 1&#160;February, the Red Army began a large offensive, firing 300,000 shells into the Finnish line in the first 24&#160;hours of the <a href="/wiki/Bombardment" title="Bombardment">bombardment</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_214-215_169-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_214-215-169">[158]</a></sup></p>

<p>Although the Karelian Isthmus front was less active in January than in December, the Soviets began increasing bombardments, wearing down the defenders and softening their fortifications. During daylight hours, the Finns took shelter inside their fortifications from the bombardments and repaired damage during the night. The situation led quickly to war exhaustion among the Finns, who lost over 3,000 soldiers in <a href="/wiki/Trench_warfare" title="Trench warfare">trench warfare</a>.

The Finns proposed an <a href="/wiki/Armistice" title="Armistice">armistice</a> on 6 March, but the Soviets, wanting to keep the pressure on the Finnish government, declined the offer. The Finnish peace delegation travelled to Moscow via Stockholm and arrived on 7 March. The USSR made further demands as their military position was strong and improving. On 9 March, the Finnish military situation on the Karelian Isthmus was dire as troops were experiencing heavy casualties. Artillery ammunition was exhausted and weapons were wearing out. The Finnish government, noting that the hoped-for Franco-British military expedition would not arrive in time, as Norway and Sweden had not given the Allies right of passage, had little choice but to accept the Soviet terms.<sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[170]</a></sup></p>

<p>World opinion largely supported the Finnish cause, and the Soviet aggression was generally deemed unjustified. World War II had not yet directly affected France, the United Kingdom or the United States; the Winter War was practically the only real conflict in Europe at that time and thus held major world interest. Several foreign organisations sent material aid, and many countries granted credit and military materiel to Finland. Nazi Germany allowed arms to pass through Sweden to Finland, but after a Swedish newspaper made this public, Adolf Hitler initiated a policy of silence towards Finland, as part of improved German–Soviet relations following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_194-202_189-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_194-202-189">[178]</a></sup></p>

<p>France had been one of the earliest supporters of Finland during the Winter War. The French saw an opportunity to weaken Germany's major ally if the Finns were to attack the Soviet Union. France had other motives as well, because it preferred to have a major war in a remote part of Europe over one on French soil. France planned to re‑arm the <a href="/wiki/Polish_Armed_Forces_in_the_West" title="Polish Armed Forces in the West">Polish exile units</a> and transport them to the Finnish Arctic port of Petsamo. Another proposed scheme was to execute a massive air strike with <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> cooperation against the <a href="/wiki/Caucasus" title="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> <a href="/wiki/Oil_field" title="Oil field">oil fields</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_235-236_193-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_235-236-193">[182]</a></sup></p>

<p>On 19 December, French Prime Minister <a href="/wiki/%C3%89douard_Daladier" title="Édouard Daladier">Édouard Daladier</a> introduced his plan to the General Staff and the War Cabinet.

The expedition troops would disembark at the Norwegian port of Narvik and proceed by rail toward Finland, passing through the Swedish ore fields on the way. This demand was sent to Norway and Sweden on 6 January, but it was likewise rejected six days later.<sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">[187]</a></sup></p>
<p>Stymied but not yet dissuaded from the possibility of action, the Allies formulated a final plan on 29 January. First, the Finns would make a formal request for assistance. Then, the Allies would ask Norway and Sweden for permission to move the "volunteers" across their territory.

<p>The Finnish strategy was dictated by geography. The 1,340&#160;km (830&#160;mi) long frontier with the Soviet Union was mostly impassable except along a handful of <a href="/wiki/Unpaved_road" class="mw-redirect" title="Unpaved road">unpaved roads</a>.

In the estimation, the manpower ratio would have favoured the attacker by three to one. The true ratio was much higher; for example, 12 Soviet divisions were deployed to the north of Lake Ladoga.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_42-44_103-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_42-44-103">[92]</a></sup></p>
<p>An even greater problem than lack of soldiers was the lack of materiel; foreign shipments of anti-tank weapons and aircraft were arriving in small quantities. The ammunition situation was alarming, as stockpiles had cartridges, shells, and fuel only to last 19–60 days. The ammunition shortage meant the Finns could seldom afford <a href="/wiki/Counter-battery_fire" title="Counter-battery fire">counterbattery</a> or <a href="/wiki/Saturation_fire" title="Saturation fire">saturation fire</a>.

<p>The Mannerheim Line, an array of Finnish defence structures, was located on the Karelian Isthmus approximately 30 to 75&#160;km (19 to 47&#160;mi) from the Soviet border. The Red Army soldiers on the Isthmus numbered 250,000, facing 130,000 Finns.<sup id="cite_ref-UittoGeust8_114-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-UittoGeust8-114">[103]</a></sup> The Finnish command deployed a <a href="/wiki/Defence_in_depth" title="Defence in depth">defence in depth</a> of about 21,000 men in the area in front of the Mannerheim Line to delay and damage the Red Army before it reached the line.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_69_115-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_69-115">[104]</a></sup></p>
<p>In combat, the most severe cause of confusion among Finnish soldiers was Soviet tanks.

According to Trotter, the favoured Soviet armoured tactic was a simple frontal charge, the weaknesses of which could be exploited. The Finns learned that at close range, tanks could be dealt with in many ways; for example, logs and crowbars jammed into the <a href="/wiki/Bogie#Tracked_vehicles" title="Bogie">bogie wheels</a> would often immobilise a tank. Soon, Finns fielded a better ad hoc weapon, the <a href="/wiki/Molotov_cocktail" title="Molotov cocktail">Molotov cocktail</a>, a glass bottle filled with <a href="/wiki/Flammability" class="mw-redirect" title="Flammability">flammable</a> liquids and with a simple hand-lit <a href="/wiki/Fuse_(explosives)" title="Fuse (explosives)">fuse</a>.

<p>By 6 December, all of the Finnish covering forces had withdrawn to the Mannerheim Line. The Red Army began its first major attack against the Line in <a href="/wiki/Solovyovo,_Priozersky_District,_Leningrad_Oblast" title="Solovyovo, Priozersky District, Leningrad Oblast">Taipale</a>—the area between the shore of Lake Ladoga, the <a href="/wiki/Burnaya_River" title="Burnaya River">Taipale river</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Suvanto" class="mw-redirect" title="Suvanto">Suvanto</a> waterway.

The men were freezing and starving and endured poor sanitary conditions. Historian William R. Trotter described these conditions as follows: "The Soviet soldier had no choice. If he refused to fight, he would be shot. If he tried to sneak through the forest, he would freeze to death. And surrender was no option for him; Soviet propaganda had told him how the Finns would torture prisoners to death."<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_148-149_126-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_148-149-126">[115]</a></sup></p>

<p>The terrain on the Karelian Isthmus did not allow guerrilla tactics, so the Finns were forced to resort to the more conventional Mannerheim Line, with its flanks protected by large bodies of water. Soviet propaganda claimed that it was as strong as or even stronger than the <a href="/wiki/Maginot_Line" title="Maginot Line">Maginot Line</a>. Finnish historians, for their part, have belittled the line's strength, insisting that it was mostly conventional trenches and log-covered <a href="/wiki/Dugout_(shelter)" title="Dugout (shelter)">dugouts</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_62-63_127-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_62-63-127">[116]</a></sup> The Finns had built 221 strong-points along the Karelian Isthmus, mostly in the early 1920s. Many were extended in the late 1930s. Despite these defensive preparations, even the most fortified section of the Mannerheim Line had only one <a href="/wiki/Reinforced_concrete" title="Reinforced concrete">reinforced concrete</a> bunker per kilometre. Overall, the line was weaker than similar lines in mainland Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-Vuore1999_494-495_128-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Vuore1999_494-495-128">[117]</a></sup> According to the Finns, the real strength of the line were the "stubborn defenders with a lot of <i><a href="/wiki/Sisu" title="Sisu">sisu</a></i>" – a Finnish idiom roughly translated as "<a href="/wiki/Courage" title="Courage">guts, fighting spirit</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-Trotter_62-63_127-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Trotter_62-63-127">[116]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the eastern side of the Isthmus, the Red Army attempted to break through the Mannerheim Line at the battle of Taipale. On the western side, Soviet units faced the Finnish line at Summa, near the city of <a href="/wiki/Viipuri" class="mw-redirect" title="Viipuri">Vyborg</a>, on 16 December. The Finns had built 41 reinforced concrete bunkers in the Summa area, making the defensive line in this area stronger than anywhere else on the Karelian Isthmus. Because of a mistake in planning, the nearby Munasuo swamp had a 1&#160;km (0.62&#160;mi)-wide gap in the line.<sup id="cite_ref-Laaks1999_407_129-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Laaks1999_407-129">[118]</a></sup> During the first <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Summa" title="Battle of Summa">battle of Summa</a>, a number of Soviet tanks broke through the thin line on 19 December, but the Soviets could not benefit from the situation because of insufficient cooperation between branches of service. The Finns remained in their trenches, allowing the Soviet tanks to move freely behind the Finnish line, as the Finns had no proper anti-tank weapons. The Finns succeeded in repelling the main Soviet assault. The tanks, stranded behind enemy lines, attacked the strongpoints at random until they were eventually destroyed, 20 in all. By 22 December, the battle ended in a Finnish victory.<sup id="cite_ref-Laaks1999_411-412_130-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Laaks1999_411-412-130">[119]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Soviet advance was stopped at the Mannerheim Line. Red Army troops suffered from poor morale and a shortage of supplies, eventually refusing to participate in more <a href="/wiki/Human_wave_attack" title="Human wave attack">suicidal frontal attacks</a>. The Finns, led by General <a href="/wiki/Harald_%C3%96hquist" title="Harald Öhquist">Harald Öhquist</a>, decided to launch a counterattack and encircle three Soviet divisions into a <i>motti</i> near Vyborg on 23 December.

<p>Contrary to Finnish expectations, the encircled Soviet divisions did not try to break through to the east but instead entrenched.

As the Finns lacked the necessary heavy artillery equipment and were short of men, they often did not directly attack <i>mottis</i> they had created; instead, they worked to eliminate only the most dangerous threats.
